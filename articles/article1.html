				The new research reveals how supermassive black holes halt star formation, shedding light on galaxy evolution in the early universe.
            His team set out to measure the motions of stars in a distant galaxy and to understand why they appeared so old. Similar massive galaxies in the early universe were typically bustling with new star formation, and Dâ€™Eugenio, a scientist at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology in Cambridge, wondered if dust might be obscuring the young stars from view.</p>
            <p>Instead, they found that the young stars were missing entirely. The galaxy had shut down.</p>
            <p>Their findings, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02345-1"><em>Nature Astronomy</em></a> on Sept. 16, offer direct evidence of a black hole starving its host galaxy of the gas needed to form new stars, supporting a long-theorized but elusive mechanism behind galaxy death.</p>
